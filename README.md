# Drivng App Kibo
In this project you are to practice how to write class in javascript using constructor function. You will be building a drivng app that performs few operations. So here are your tasks:

 **_Please read the following tasks carefully before starting_** 

1. Use a constructor function to implement a `Car` class. The car has a `brand` and a `speed` property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects using the data below and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

- DATA CAR 1: `'Toyota' going at 100 km/h`
- DATA CAR 2: `'Benz' going at 120 km/h`

Use starter code to start the task, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!
